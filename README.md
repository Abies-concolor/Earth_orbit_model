Earth_orbit_v2.1

This is the code for the 3D Earth Orbit, Milankovitch cycles and insolation visualization and analysis model. For details and model 
documentation refer to the citation below. The code posted here is the same as in the Supplementary material of the this paper,
with a minor update to the Earth_orbit_v2_1.m file to fix a plot clipping issue. Refer to the included ReadMe.txt file in the repository
for a wuick start guide.
