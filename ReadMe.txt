The code posted here is the same as the code in the Supplement to this publication (http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/1051/2014/gmd-7-1051-2014-supplement.zip), with the exception of a minor fix to Earth_orbit_v2_1.m to correct a plot clipping issue.

+++++  Installation  Instructions  +++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is no installation per-se required. You need to have MATLAB(r) installed on your system.  Download file Earth_Orbit_v2_1.zip and unzip its contents into a
folder of your choice.  Either add the path to this folder to the MATLAB(r) path or set the current working directory to that folder.
In order to run the model, type the following at the MATLAB(r) command prompt: 
>> Earth_orbit_v2_1

and press Enter.  This should bring up the GUI with all the user controls.  These are fairly intuitive and self-explanatory.  Brief help is provided below.
For details, refer to the publication referenced above. 

If surface plots do not render properly, you may need to change the renderer used by MATLAB(r). At the prompt, type: 
>> set(gcf,'renderer','r_name')
where r_name can be opengl, painters or zbuffer. This will change the renderer for the current figure.

Note: If the GUI window is not sized properly for your system/monitor configuration (should be rare), you can change the window size (e.g. maximize it). If that 
does not work, you may need to use the "guide" tool in MATLAB(r) to resize/rearrange the GUI figure and resave it.  At the prompt, type
>> guide Earth_orbit_v2_1    

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++  Brief Model Use Help  +++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pressing the Help Button in the GUI should open this file in the MATLAB editor or another editor of your choice.
For details, refer to the publication referenced above. 

    (1) Initial Constants and Options: 
		Choose a real astronomical solution or the demo mode (user-selected Milankovitch parameters)
    (2) Milankovitch Orbital Parameters: 
        Select year since J2000 or values for the orbital parameters, depending on chosen mode. 
    
    (3) Calendar/Date, Latitude and Insolation Options:
		Select month and date, latitude (Southern hemisphere latitudes are negative),
		the TSI(S_o) value, as well as the calendar start date - either equinox
		is fixed to be March 20, or perihelion is fixed to be January 3.
		Press the "Plot/Update Orbit" button to produce/update a 3D orbital configuration plot 
		using the currently chosen input parameters, as well as update the text output in the GUI.
    
    (4) Time Series (TS) and Insolation Plotting Options:
		Depending on selected mode, various time series plots can be produced as indicated on each button.
		The plot(s) can be produced if the button is active. 
		For the astronomical solutions modes, users need to select the range of years to plot. Check the 
		corresponding box if you wish to save the plot data as ASCII files for further analysis.
    
    (5) Outputs:
		Numerical outputs update when the "Plot/Update Orbit button is pressed.
